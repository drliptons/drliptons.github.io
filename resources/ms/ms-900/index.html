<p><strong>Windows client</strong> is a <strong>comprehensive desktop operating system</strong> that allows you to work efficiently and securely.</p>
<p><strong>Windows-as-a-Service (WaaS)</strong> is a <strong>new way to work with the Windows desktop</strong>. Instead of a major release every three or four years, features are released more frequently, such as semi-annually.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Release Types</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature updates</strong> add new functionality and are released twice a year. </li>
<li><strong>Quality updates</strong> provide security and reliability fixes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Servicing channels</strong> are the first <strong>way to separate users into deployment groups</strong> for feature and quality updates</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Insider Program</strong> provides organizations with the opportunity to test and provide feedback on features that will be shipped in the next feature update. </li>
<li><strong>General Availability</strong> Channel provides new functionality with feature update releases annually</li>
<li><strong>Long-term servicing channel</strong> is designed for specialist devices that <strong>don't run Office apps</strong> such as <strong>medical equipment</strong> or <strong>ATMs</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment rings</strong> are a <strong>deployment method used to separate devices</strong> into a deployment timeline.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preview</strong> is for planning and development.</li>
<li><strong>Limited</strong> is for pilot and validation.</li>
<li><strong>Broad</strong> is for wide deployment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment methods for Windows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Modern deployment methods</strong> embrace <strong>both traditional on-premises and cloud services</strong> to deliver a streamlined, cost effective deployment experience</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Autopilot</strong> allows IT professionals to customize the out-of-box experience (OOBE) to deploy apps and settings that are pre-configured for your organization. </li>
<li><strong>In-place</strong> upgrade provides a simple, automated process that uses the Windows setup process to upgrade from an earlier version of Windows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic deployment methods</strong> enable you to <strong>configure applications and settings for specific use cases</strong> without having to deploy a new custom organization image to the device.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subscription activation</strong> uses a subscription to switch from one edition of Windows to another when a licensed user signs into a device.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) joined with automatic mobile device management (MDM) enrollment</strong> automatically joins the device to Azure AD and is configured by MDM.</li>
<li><strong>Provisioning package configuration</strong> uses the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (ICD) tool. This tool is used to create provisioning packages that contain all the configuration, settings, and apps that can be applied to devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Traditional deployment methods</strong> use <strong>existing tools to deploy operating system images</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New computer</strong>, or also called bare metal, is when you deploy a new device or wipe an existing device and deploy with a <strong>fresh image</strong></li>
<li><strong>Computer refresh</strong>, or also called wipe-and-load, is when you redeploy a device by saving the user state, wiping the disk, then <strong>restoring the user state</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Computer replace</strong> is when you replace an existing device with a new one. You <strong>replace the device</strong> by saving the user state on the old device and then restoring it to the new device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage Windows-as-a-Service</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Configuration Manager</strong>, you can <strong>view the state of WaaS</strong> in your environment. You can create servicing plans to form deployment rings and ensure that Windows systems are up to date when new builds are released.</p>
<h4 id="identify-deployment-and-servicing-methods-for-microsoft-365-apps">Identify deployment and servicing methods for Microsoft 365 apps</h4>
<p>There are <strong>four methods to perform larger-scale deployments</strong> of Microsoft 365 Apps that we’ll discuss in the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deploy from a local source with Configuration Manager:</strong> Manage your deployment with Configuration Manager, and download and deploy Office from distribution points on your network.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy from the cloud with the Office Deployment Tool (ODT):</strong> Manage your deployment with the ODT and use the Office Customization Tool to create a configuration file in the cloud that specifies the Microsoft 365 apps that are installed. The commands run the ODT in configure mode and with a reference to the appropriate configuration file, which defines the version of Office to install on the client computer.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy from a local source with the Office Deployment Tool (ODT):</strong> Manage your deployment with the ODT, and download and deploy Office from a local source on your network.</li>
<li><strong>Self-install from the cloud:</strong> Manage your deployment from the Office portal and have your users install Office on their client devices directly from the portal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Types of updates channels for Microsoft 365 Apps</p>
<p>There are three primary update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps:</p>
<p><strong>Current Channel</strong> receives feature <strong>updates at least once a month</strong>, but there's <strong>no set schedule</strong> of one the updates are released. This channel also <strong>receives security and non-security updates</strong> around two or three times a month, including one on the second Tuesday of the month. Microsoft recommends this channel because it provides users with the newest Office features as soon as they’re ready.
<strong>Monthly Enterprise Channel</strong> receives feature <strong>updates once a month</strong>, on the <strong>second Tuesday of the month</strong>. This monthly update can include <strong>feature, security, and non-security updates</strong>. Microsoft recommends this channel if you want to provide your users with new Office features once a month on a predictable release schedule.
<strong>Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel</strong> receives feature <strong>updates every six months</strong>, in <strong>January and July</strong> on the second Tuesday of the month. This update can include <strong>feature, security, and non-security updates</strong>. Microsoft recommends this channel only for those select devices in your organization where extensive testing is needed before rolling out new Office features.</p>
<p>Microsoft provides each update channel with <strong>two types of updates</strong> that are released on the second Tuesday of every month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security updates:</strong> such as updates that <strong>help keep Office protected</strong> from potential malicious attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Non-security updates:</strong> (quality updates) such as updates that <strong>provide stability or performance improvements</strong> for Office.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="describe-the-shared-responsibility-and-the-defense-in-depth-security-models">Describe the shared responsibility and the defense in-depth security models.</h4>
<p>The shared responsibility model identifies which security tasks are handled by the cloud provider, and which security tasks are handled by you, the customer. The responsibilities vary depending on where the workload is hosted:</p>
<p><img alt="Shared Responsibility" src="../images/ms-365-res.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Software as a Service (SaaS):  the customer is licensed through a <strong>monthly or annual subscription</strong>. The <strong>cloud provider is responsible for managing everything</strong> except data, devices, accounts, and identities.</li>
<li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> the <strong>cloud provider manages the hardware and operating systems</strong>, and the <strong>customer is responsible for applications and data</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> the <strong>cloud customer isn't responsible</strong> for the <strong>physical components</strong>, such as computers, the <strong>network</strong>, or the <strong>physical security</strong> of the datacenter. However, the cloud customer <strong>still has responsibility</strong> for <strong>software components</strong> such as operating systems, <strong>network controls, applications, and protecting data</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>On-premises datacenter:</strong> <strong>you have responsibility for everything</strong> from physical security to encrypting sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Defense in depth</strong> uses a layered approach to security, rather than relying on a single perimeter. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical security:</strong> such as <strong>limiting access to a datacenter</strong> to only authorized personnel.</li>
<li><strong>Identity and access:</strong> security controls such as <strong>multifactor authentication</strong> or condition-based access, to control access to infrastructure and change control.</li>
<li><strong>Perimeter:</strong> security of your corporate network includes distributed denial of service (<strong>DDoS</strong>) protection to filter large-scale attacks before they can cause a denial of service for users.</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> security such as <strong>network segmentation and network access controls</strong>, to limit communication between resources.</li>
<li><strong>Compute:</strong> layer security such as <strong>securing access to virtual machines</strong> either on-premises or in the cloud by closing certain ports.</li>
<li><strong>Application:</strong> layer security to <strong>ensure applications are secure</strong> and free of security vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> layer security including controls to manage access to business and customer data and <strong>encryption</strong> to protect data.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Defense in depth" src="../images/ms-365-def-layers.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)</strong> is a defense in-depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong> refers to the need to keep confidential sensitive data such as <strong>customer information, passwords, or financial data</strong>.
<strong>Integrity</strong> refers to keeping <strong>data or messages correct</strong>
<strong>Availability</strong> refers to making data available to those who need it, when they need it. It's important to the organization to <strong>keep customer data secure</strong>,</p>
<h4 id="describe-the-zero-trust-model">Describe the Zero-Trust model.</h4>
<p>Zero Trust assumes everything is on an open and untrusted network, even resources behind the firewalls of the corporate network. The Zero Trust model operates on the principle of <strong>“trust no one, verify everything.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zero Trust guiding principles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verify explicitly:</strong> <strong>always authenticate and authorize</strong> based on the available data points, including user identity, location, device, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.</li>
<li><strong>Least privileged access:</strong> limit user access with <strong>just-in-time</strong> and <strong>just-enough access (JIT/JEA)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Assume breach:</strong> segment access by network, user, devices, and application. Use <strong>encryption to protect data</strong>, and use analytics to get visibility, detect threats, and improve your security.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Six foundational pillars</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identities:</strong> users must be verified with strong authentication</li>
<li><strong>Devices:</strong> monitoring devices for health and compliance</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> the way that data is consumed, managing permissions and access</li>
<li><strong>Data:</strong> should be classified, labeled, and encrypted based on its attributes</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> improve security, you assess for version, configuration, and JIT access, and use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies.</li>
<li><strong>Networks:</strong> segmented, including deeper in-network micro segmentation, real-time threat protection, end-to-end encryption, monitoring, and analytics should be employed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="describe-the-concepts-of-encryption-and-hashing">Describe the concepts of encryption and hashing.</h4>
<p><strong>Encryption:</strong> is the <strong>process of making data unreadable and unusable</strong> to unauthorized viewers</p>
<p><img alt="Encryption" src="../images/ms-365-encyp.png" /></p>
<p>There are two top-level types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symmetric encryption</strong> uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. </li>
<li><strong>Asymmetric encryption</strong> uses a public key and private key pair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Encryption may protect data at rest, or in transit.</p>
<p><strong>Encryption for data at rest:</strong> is the data that's stored on a <strong>physical device</strong>, such as a server
<strong>Encryption for data in transit:</strong>  is the data <strong>moving</strong> from one location to another, such as across the internet or through a private network
<strong>Encryption for data in use:</strong>  securing data in <strong>non-persistent storage</strong>, such as RAM or CPU caches</p>
<p><strong>Hashing</strong> uses an algorithm to <strong>convert text to a unique fixed-length value</strong> called a hash. Hashing is used to store passwords.</p>
<p><img alt="Hashing" src="../images/ms-365-hash.png" /></p>
<p>Hashing is different to encryption in that it doesn't use keys, and the hashed value isn't subsequently decrypted back to the original.</p>
<h4 id="describe-some-basic-compliance-concepts">Describe some basic compliance concepts.</h4>
<p>Government agencies and industry groups have issued regulations to help protect and govern the use of data. From personal and financial information to data protection and privacy, organizations can be accountable for meeting dozens of regulations to be compliant. Listed below are some important concepts and terms that relate to data compliance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data residency:</strong> govern the physical locations <strong>where data can be stored</strong> and <strong>how and when it can be transferred, processed, or accessed</strong> internationally</li>
<li><strong>Data sovereignty:</strong> <strong>data</strong> is subject to the <strong>laws and regulations of the country/region</strong> in which it's physically collected, held, or processed</li>
<li><strong>Data privacy:</strong> Providing <strong>notice and being transparent about the collection, processing, use, and sharing of personal data</strong> are fundamental principles of privacy laws and regulations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="describe-identity-concepts">Describe identity concepts</h3>
<h4 id="define-authentication-and-authorization">Define authentication and authorization</h4>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong> is the process of proving that a person is who they say they are (<strong>Who are you?</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Authorization</strong> is to decide where they can go, and what they're allowed to see and touch (<strong>What can you do?</strong>)</p>
<p>Enterprise security needs to adapt to this new reality. The security perimeter can no longer be viewed as the on-premises network.</p>
<p><strong>Four pillars of an identity infrastructure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administration</strong> is about the <strong>creation and management/governance</strong> of identities for users, devices, and services</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong> tells the story of <strong>how much an IT system needs to know about an identity</strong> to have sufficient proof that they really are who they say they are</li>
<li><strong>Authorization</strong> is about processing the incoming identity data to <strong>determine the level of access</strong> an authenticated person or service has within the application or service that it wants to access.</li>
<li><strong>Auditing</strong> is about <strong>tracking</strong> who does what, when, where, and how</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Modern authentication</strong> is an umbrella <strong>term for authentication and authorization methods between a client</strong>, such as your laptop or phone, <strong>and a server</strong>, like a website or application. At the center of modern authentication is the role of the identity provider. An identity provider creates, maintains, and manages identity information while offering authentication, authorization, and auditing services.</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure Active Directory is an example of a cloud-based identity provider. Other examples include Twitter, Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, and GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>Single sign-on</strong></p>
<p>Another fundamental capability of an identity provider and “modern authentication” is the support for single sign-on (SSO). With SSO, the <strong>user logs in once and that credential is used to access multiple applications</strong> or resources.</p>
<h4 id="describe-the-concept-of-directory-services-and-active-directory">Describe the concept of directory services and Active Directory</h4>
<p>A <strong>directory service</strong> stores directory data and makes it available to network users, administrators, services, and applications.</p>
<p><strong>Active Directory (AD)</strong> is a set of directory services developed by Microsoft as part of Windows 2000 for on-premises domain-based networks. The best-known service of this kind is <strong>Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)</strong>.</p>
<p>It provides organizations with an <strong>Identity as a Service (IDaaS)</strong> solution for all their apps across cloud and on-premises. In this course, we'll focus on Azure AD, Microsoft’s cloud-based identity provider.</p>

<h4 id="identify-how-to-track-the-service-health-status">Identify how to track the service health status</h4>
<p>Your organization’s administrators can use the <strong>Microsoft 365 admin center</strong> to view the current health status for each of your Microsoft 365 services and tenant. </p>
<p><strong>Keep track of incidents</strong></p>
<p>Your organization can set up notifications for any new incidents, or for updates to any active incidents that might affect your organization. Microsoft will provide two different types of notifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unplanned downtime:</strong> where an incident has caused a service to become unresponsive or unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>Planned maintenance:</strong> where Microsoft regularly carries out service updates to the software and infrastructure that run services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your organization can keep <strong>track of the health status</strong> of services in different ways:</p>
<p><strong>Admin app:</strong> use the Admin App to view and stay up to date with the health status of the services
<strong>Microsoft system center:</strong> view all service communications from within System Center
<strong>API:</strong> use the Office 365 Service Communications API</p>
<p>To protect and keep your organization’s data available Microsoft does the following:</p>
<p><strong>Data storage redundancy:</strong> microsoft <strong>stores your data through multiple levels of redundancy</strong> using data replication and secure data protection capabilities
<strong>Monitoring data:</strong> your <strong>databases are monitored</strong> for you. Your data is monitored packet loss, latencies in queries, and more.

<h4 id="describe-private-public-preview-and-general-availability-releases">Describe private, public preview, and general availability releases</h4>
<p>A product or service lifecycle typically has three phases:</p>
<p><strong>Private preview</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft might release a product or service to a <strong>limited number of users</strong> to test and evaluate new features or functionality. This phase <strong>doesn't include formal support</strong>. Typically, <strong>users can sign up</strong> to be members of a private preview, but the preview release <strong>isn't made available to the public.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Public preview</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft typically releases public previews of products and services <strong>before their GA release</strong> to <strong>receive feedback from a broad range of users</strong>. These products and services are <strong>clearly marked as preview</strong> and <strong>include beta or pre-release features and services</strong>. This phase <strong>allows users to explore and test upcoming functionality</strong>. Users may also <strong>receive some limited support</strong> depending on the product or service.</p>
<p><strong>General availability (GA)</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft <strong>releases</strong> the product or service. The product or service becomes <strong>available to all customers</strong> with <strong>formal support</strong>, known as the <strong>release version</strong>. The products and services in this phase have been through a <strong>full development and test lifecycle</strong> to <strong>ensure stability and reliability</strong>. With Microsoft 365, <strong>new features are added to the products and services periodically</strong>. It's useful for IT developers, and administrators, to be aware of preview features before they have their general availability release.</p>
<p><strong>End of support</strong></p>
<p><strong>Older products or retired services</strong> can no longer be supported, and these products and services will reach the end of support. Once a product or service reaches end of support, it will <strong>no longer receive updates or assisted support</strong>. </p>
<h4 id="describe-the-modern-lifecycle-policy">Describe the Modern Lifecycle Policy</h4>
