Notes of my projects or whatever I find interesting. I like to take notes. But, the more I took the more I find it difficult to find what I'm searching for in my offline notes. I have a few different platforms and apps but never really found the one that gave me the tools that I needed. I decided to create my own page with the help of mkdocs and GitHub. That was just the right combination. Note As of the time of writing this page, I haven't settled on the structure. I'm still experimenting and trying different tools that are available to use. When you're browsing through the pages you might notice that some projects have a lot of notes and some only have a few. This is intentional since some of them I haven't written any notes when first created. What can be expected For now, not much, but more and more are coming. Here are some highlights of what I'm working on. Python projects There are a lot of codes that have been tested and edited during the development of a project. Most of them might be only a few lines and not even a working program, just a function. But some of them are a part of a larger project that is worth extracting, revisiting, and share it to the world. I have spent some amount of time cleaning up the code to make it easier to read instead of just abandoning it and letting it be forgotten in the deepest part of a memory drive. All codes that have been made available here are free to use. I would be glad if any of it would help you learn of progress in your work. Please feel free to browse here TensorFlow Certificate Exam I have made personal notes of mine when getting the TensorFlow certificate exam available here. All the resources that I used to help me pass to get through the exam. And Yes I passed! The notes I made during the study for the exam are still in raw format and with really few notes that I only understand. I'm still cleaning it up and adding more explanations to make it a bit more understandable. I figured when making it public, I should make it right. TensorFlow projects I'm really fascinated with machine learning and TensorFlow. Since ever I encounter TensorFlow and have seen its potential, I can't stop finding new solutions that I could work with. From time to time I will test new models and datasets. When a project is finished at a certain level, I will share it here. The result might not be significant, but it's the journey that does.

Space Invaders was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and launched in 1978. The game was a tremendous success with grossed $3.8 billion. I think we all know how fun this game is. For more information about the original game here . I have spent so many great hours in my childhood playing this game. On one weekend, I decided to make a quick clone with python.

The application can generate a random password that contains letters, numbers, and symbols. The length of the password will randomly vary between 12 and 18 symbols. Users can save their generated username and password in the application and search for it later. The user interface is made with Tkinter and is nothing fancy. I have noted that at the time of writing this readme file, Tkinter isn't much enjoyable in some function on mac as of on windows. Mac users might be frustrated sometimes when Tkinter isn't working as expected. \u2192 Continue reading Text to Morse Code Easy convert text into morse code \ud83d\uddd3 Added: February 17, 2022 A funny little side project to translate text into morse code.

As a final result the converted morse code text will be shown on the console and a sound illustration will be played for each text. \u2192 Continue reading Stock News Alert Easy convert text into morse code \ud83d\uddd3 Added: February 17, 2022 Stock News Alert is a little project for retrieving stock news by calling an API of a news website. It was intended to be a messenger \ud83d\ude9a (kinda) to deliver the news. The news was originally supposed to be sent by Twilio. But somehow they charge money. I needed an alternative and got the idea to send the news to discord instead.

The application can generate a random password that contains letters, numbers, and symbols. The length of the password will randomly vary between 12 and 18 symbols. Users can save their generated username and password in the application and search for it later. The user interface is made with Tkinter and is nothing fancy. I have noted that at the time of writing this readme file, Tkinter isn't much enjoyable in some function on mac as of on windows. Mac users might be frustrated sometimes when Tkinter isn't working as expected. I really can't remember where I did the logo in this app. But I can be sure that it was on an online logo-creating website. Anyone who wants to quickly generate a logo, please visit our best pal google.
