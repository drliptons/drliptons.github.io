Full Project List Python projects Alien Invaders Password Manager Text2MorseCode Stock News Alert TensorFlow Plant Disease Detection Python projects Alien Invaders A clone of one of the most successful game in the world \"SPACE INVADERS\" \ud83d\uddd3 Added: February 20, 2022 Alien Invaders is a game inspired by the original game Space Invaders by Taito Corporation. Space Invaders was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and launched in 1978. The game was a tremendous success with grossed $3.8 billion. I think we all know how fun this game is. For more information about the original game here . I have spent so many great hours in my childhood playing this game. On one weekend, I decided to make a quick clone with python. The game still lacks a couple of functions, but it was close to what I have expected. \u2192 Continue reading Password Manager Generate and save your password \ud83d\uddd3 Added: February 17, 2022 Password Manager is a simple password-generating application. The application can generate a random password that contains letters, numbers, and symbols. The length of the password will randomly vary between 12 and 18 symbols. Users can save their generated username and password in the application and search for it later. The user interface is made with Tkinter and is nothing fancy. I have noted that at the time of writing this readme file, Tkinter isn't much enjoyable in some function on mac as of on windows. Mac users might be frustrated sometimes when Tkinter isn't working as expected. \u2192 Continue reading Text to Morse Code Easy convert text into morse code \ud83d\uddd3 Added: February 17, 2022 A funny little side project to translate text into morse code.
